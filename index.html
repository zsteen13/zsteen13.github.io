						<h2>Professional Information</h2>
						<p align="justify">I studied Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University and graduated in May 2021. I minored in
						mathematics and business.</p>&nbsp
						<p align="justify">I am currently enrolled at the University of Texas at Austin, for a Masters of Science in Computer Science.</p>&nbsp
						<p align="justify">After completing an internship with USAA during Summer 2020, I accepted a full-time Software Engineering position with them.
							I will be working with them from September 2021 on.
						</p>&nbsp
						<p align="justify">I worked as an intern at Atriecon SDG during Summer 2019, as an Architectural drafter. I had never
						drafted technical drawings before, but learned AutoCAD very quickly, and actually earned 2 raises by the end of my internship!
						I worked on 11 different projects, drawing details of electrical, mechanical, structural, civil, and plumbing components. I also
						got to inspect job sites with an Engineer. You can see some of the details I created in the <a href="#portfolio">portfolio</a> section, many of which are
						being used in construction right now at various sites around Texas!</p>&nbsp
						<p>I love all of the work I've done so far, and can't wait to do more good work. Take a look at my resume.</p><p>(click for downloadable pdf)</p>

						<h2>My Portfolio</h2>
						<p align="justify">For my senior design project, a partner and I developed an augmented reality project using the Microsoft HoloLens 2 system. The research was for the Texas A&M University Electrical Engineering Department, and we primarily coded it in C#.

						<p align="justify">I was an IT intern at USAA, where I mostly did frontend development using the React JavaScript framework. Take a look at my capstone presentation below for a complete overview, which I presented to almost 50 of my peers:</p><br>

						<br>
						<br>
						<p align="justify">During my senior year of college, I took a software engineering course where I participated in an Agile Scrum team as the product owner and a core developer. I gained valuable experience developing a point tracker application for TAMU Engineering Honors.
						As product owner, I served as the communicator between our development team and our client, and would convert user concerns and needs into stories for our team. As a core developer, I gained full-stack development experience from scratch using the Ruby on Rails framework and a PostgreSQL database.

						<p align="justify">At Atriecon SDG, I translated and fixed C language code written for 16-bit machines into C++ code for modern computers. I also drafted many details in AutoCAD. These drawings are currently being used by contractors during construction of several

								<h3>MacTeach</h3>
								<p>When I was in high school, I tutored at 7AM before school at Oak Grove Elementary School in San Antonio, Texas.
								This program focused on mentoring and tutoring at-risk students. I was able to be present in the lives of children
								that did not have stable home lives and improved their reading, writing, and math skills by running a computer lab.
								I also tutored my peers during my lunch hour. Read <a href="https://www.expressnews.com/news/education/article/High-school-club-helps-refugees-children-and-10611805.php" target="_blank">this</a>

								<h3>The Big Event</h3>
								<p>Each year at Texas A&M University, I participate in the Big Event, an annual service project in which students
								volunteer around the Bryan-College Station area. In 2019 alone, over 2,000 residents were served during the Big Event!
								I've served as a volunteer providing labor and as a site leader providing administration, and am excited 
								to participate again. Learn more <a href="https://bigevent.tamu.edu/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

								<h3>Aggies Beyond Campus</h3>
								<p>MacTeach helped me to develop a love for tutoring and mentoring, which led to the creation of ABC. ABC seeks to implement
								the tutoring and mentoring model for at-risk children around Texas A&M. Last year, a few other tutors and I went to College Hills
								Elementary School weekly to provide assistance to teachers in the classroom, and additionally provide individual help the lagging students.</p>
